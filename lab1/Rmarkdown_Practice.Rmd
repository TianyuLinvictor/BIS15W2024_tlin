```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Practice
1. Test out the arithmetic capabilities of R; experiment by doing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  

```{r}
#addition
2+3
```

```{r}
#subtraction
2-3
```

```{r}
#multiplication
2*3
```

```{r}
#division
2/3
```

2. Go back to your "RMarkdown Practice" file and experiment with titles, text, and syntax.  

## tital
### tital
#### tital

the cat  
on the tree. 

3. Copy and paste the following two pieces of code into the document (include the gray code "chunks").      

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = factor(cyl))) +
    geom_bar()
```

4. Now `knit` the file to html using the knit button at the top of the page.  
5. Lastly, commit and push this file to your GitHub repository.
